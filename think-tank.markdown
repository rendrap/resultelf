section-date: 2020-07-05 00:00:00 Z
paragraph-bold: Since intelligence is a nebulous concept, it is clear the artificial
  intelligence is more so. Let’s delve into the question of what it is, and what it
  isn’t — and clear up some misconceptions on the way.

  discourse are aware of what it actually is. Indeed, part of the problem is that

  once read a story about a certain Mr Gardner, who claimed that “my iPhone seemed
  to&nbsp; **understand**&nbsp;what I saying, but it was&nbsp;**illusory**”. But nowhere

  did not really "understand", nor even what his criteria for "understanding" are."
